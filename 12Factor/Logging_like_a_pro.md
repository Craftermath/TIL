# Logging Like a Pro   
Today I watched [the PyCon talk video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxyrmsxY2KA) of a highly skilled backend developer [Bianca Rosa](https://github.com/biancarosa) about her personal takes on logging and observability.   

I saved here in my 12Factor folder because I find very related with [the factor XI - Logs](https://12factor.net/logs), summarized by "Treat logs as event streams".   

So Today I Learned that a good practice is to use **PLAIN TEXT** (without variables) **+ extra fields** in the log messages along identifiers for traceability purpose.   

The talk had a lot more information and this TIL subject was chosen for my future me could come back to all those references above and listed here:
