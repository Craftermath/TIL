## Usage   
Steps to follow:   

1. Create directories for specific topics.   

2. Inside those directories create a [`Markdown`](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) 
file with your title for example `How_to_autogenerate_a_README.md`, 
`Create_a_simple_App.md` etc. Make sure that the markdown file has a title. 
Spaces in titles are _not_ recommended since different services render markdown differently.   

3. Every Markdown TIL file should start with a `#` i.e h1 heading.   

4. Run `python createTIL.py` to auto-generate the new README file for you   

OR  

If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit. Use the following command:  
`cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createtil.py pre-commit && cd -`   

5. Once satisfied push your changes.
